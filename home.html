    <p>Hey There! I know it's weird but, why not a website? <br> Thought of giving you a gift, but I could not find the one within the price range, being 250 that is. I make speeches every year naa, why not include this in a site?
     Scroll down you will see some cool image animations and all, I hope. Stay as much as you want and feel free to contact if you want anything changed in the site. <span style="color: red;">&#10084;</span> </p>

    <p>I see you want to stay, ok let me decide what to type. As I am trying to keep it professional, there are a lot of limitations to my way of speaking. Sorry if this took too long but it was a last minute idea. Like, why not? Oh yeah by the way, if you click on the quiz you cannot come back to this place as I could not add the menu in.</p>

    <p>Then I started thinking, what will make this site a little bit better? A collection of our photos? A game? Maybe a list of what makes us, us. But nahh, too cliche. Then it popped, why not a quiz? .<br></p>
